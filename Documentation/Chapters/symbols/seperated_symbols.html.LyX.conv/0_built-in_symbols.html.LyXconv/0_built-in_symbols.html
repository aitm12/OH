<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >This section is largely based on the information originally written by Ray Bornert
(<a 
href="http://www.winholdem.net/help/help-formula.html#symbols" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.winholdem.net/help/help-formula.html#symbols</span></a>) and extended to
include OpenHoldem-specific symbols.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   These symbols take output from the scraper engine, from Table Map parameters,
and from your formula functions to derive various bits of data that are useful when
instructing the OpenHoldem Autoplayer how to act. The set of symbols got
extended over time &#8211; not all of them are available for all versions of OpenHoldem.
This list reflects the state of the latest version. Some old WinHoldem symbols
got never implemented due to lack of documentation and practical relevance.
Others got replaced or removed over time. Please refer to the chapter &#8220;Outdated
Features and Incompatibilities between OpenHoldem and WinHoldem&#8221; for more
information.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   As you already might have noticed some of these symbols are of rather technical
nature, A set of several hundred more poker-logical symbols is included in the
OpenPPL-library that gets discussed in the seeparate OpenPPL-manual. Both languages
can be mixed in nearly any way however, so please read on. Here you will find some
valuable symbols that you might be miss in OpenPPL.
